The Student Grading System is a digital platform designed to simplify and automate the process of evaluating student performance. It enables teachers and administrators to manage student records, input scores, calculate grades, and generate reports efficiently. This system helps reduce manual errors, saves time, and ensures transparency in academic assessments.
